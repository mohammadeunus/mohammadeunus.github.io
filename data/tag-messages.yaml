reverse-engineering: |
  The ABP code structure has always fascinated me. This curiosity drove me to dive deep into their codebase, where I learned a great deal. Over time, I became highly proficient with the ABP Framework. My passion for it inspired me to extend and adapt it to meet unique client needs. This journey has been one of the most rewarding parts of my software career and I still dream of building a framework as robust as ABP myself one day.
